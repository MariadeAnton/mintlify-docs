## Ingesting behavioural data from Segment
_August 25th, 2023_

### What

Valued supports a Segment integration which ingests Page, Screen, Track, Group and Identity events.

### Why

Intgrating onto a new behavioural tracking tool can be difficult, especially if engineering time is currently limited. This change allows you to leverage your existing Segment integration to send us the events you already send there.

## Custom revenue ingestion: send subscription and invoice data via Valued
_August 11th, 2023_

### What

The Valued integration now accepts a new category of message `revenue` which ingests details relating to invoices, subscriptions, plans and prices.

### Why

Not every organization uses "insert large payment processor here". This change allows us to ingest events related to revenue via the Valued integration type so if you've got a custom method for billing your customers we can associate those details in Valued.

### Further details

## Default signals for user sessions
_August 3rd, 2023_

### What

By default Valued projects get two new Signals when they are created, the number of user sessions over 28 days and the number unique users over 28 days.

### Why

Tracking your users usage of you application is one of the best signals of retention. Simply put if they are not using your application they are unlikely to renew their subscription. This change adds two new signals to every project by default
