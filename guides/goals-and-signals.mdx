title: Goals and Signals
description: Configure goals and signals for your customers to reach.
---

Configuration of [goals](/core-resources/goal) and [signals](/core-resources/signal) happens through the [config](/events/config) event type. In this guide, you will learn how to design your goals and signals, and how to send those through to your Valued project.

Valued provides two ways to configure goals and signals: GitHub Actions or one of the [SDKs](/guides/sdks). GitHub Actions is the recommended way.

## Github Actions

In the following example, we are point of sale SaaS company and we are creating two goals for our customers:

* Customer making their first widget sale
* Customer receiving 6 payments

And, a signal to check if sales drop have dropped by 10% or more in the last 28 days in comparison to the previous.

### Single configuration file 

You can create a single configuration file called `valued.yaml` or `.valued.yaml` either at the top level, or inside a directory called `config` or `.config`.

Valued's configuration file supports `.json`, `.toml`, `.yml` and `.yaml` formats.

#### Example

`.config/valued.yaml`

```yaml
goals:
- name: Created a sale
  action_key: sale.created
- name: 6 payments receieved
  action_key: payment.received
  threshold: 6
signals:
- name: Monthly sales
  action_key: sale.created
  outcome: negative
  threshold: -10
  period: 28d
```

### Multiple files

You can also create individual configuration files for goals and signals.

Create a `valued`, `.valued`, `config/valued`, or `.config/valued` directory, and add one `goals.toml` and one `signals.toml` file.

#### Example

`.valued/goals.toml`

```toml
["Created a sale"]
action-key = "sale.created"

["6 payments received"]
action-key = "payment.received"
threshold = 6
```

`.valued/signals.toml`

```toml
["Monthly sales"]
action-key = "sale.created"
outcome = "negative"
threshold = -10
period = "28d"
```

### Set up the GitHub Action

1. Obtain a token for the Valued API. In the Valued Dashboard, click Integrations and copy "API Key". Store it in the `VALUED_API_KEY` secret.

2. Add the following step to your GitHub Action workflow:

```yaml
- uses: valued-app/config-sync@main
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.VALUED_API_KEY }}
```

A full workflow only pushing the configuration might look like this:

```yaml
name: valued-config-sync

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  config-upload:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Upload Valued configuration
        uses: valued-app/config-sync@main
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.VALUED_TOKEN }}
```
