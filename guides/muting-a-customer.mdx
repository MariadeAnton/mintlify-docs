description: Mute a customer to stop them appearing in the prioritization lists.

After reaching out to a customer muting them allows you to remove them from the priority lists. This prevents you, and others, reaching out to the same customer for a period of one week. Returning a customer to the prioritization is as simple as un-muting them from their details page.
