In this guide, you will learn the basics of Valued so you can send data and analyze your customers' behaviour.

## Before you begin

To complete this tutorial, you'll need:

* A Valued account, organization and project.

    Start by browsing to [Highly Valued](https://highly.valued.app) and signing in with your Google account. Follow the steps to create an organization and a project.
     * An organization distinguishes your company on Valued. Add a name that represents your organization.
     * A project is used to identify the different environments in your application or, different applications themselves.
  
## Valued basics

* **Customers** - these can be companies, organizations or teams within your company. It's an account that can subscribe to your product. If you're a B2B product, several users will belong to a single customer and if you're a B2B2C, you'll also have single-user customers, that might grow to multiple-users.
* **User** - an individual who performs actions in your product. Users can belong to one or more companies. 
* **Customer memberships** - what you use to let us know the exact relationship between a customer and a user.

* **Events** - these are pageviews, syncs, actions, everything that a user can do within your product or application. An event can be performed by a user in a customer account or in their own profile. Send events referencing both so that the event shows up linked to both a customer and a user accordingly. 
  * When a user updates their profile 
    * send a /sync event to Valued
    * send a /pageview that user viewed profile page
    * send an /action event that user updated their profile
