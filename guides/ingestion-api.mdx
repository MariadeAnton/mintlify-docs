title: Event Ingestion API
description: Sending event data from your application.
---

Send `sync`, `action`, `screen`, `pageview`, `config` and `revenue` events through the `events` ingestion API.

The endpoint to use is: `https://ingest.valued.app/events`

## OAuth2 with bearer token

When establishing a connection using OAuth2, you need your access token which you can find in the Valued dashboard under the Integrations page.

Hereâ€™s how to add the token to the request header using cURL

Two headers are required:

- `Authorization` header, for your Projects API token in the form of `Bearer {token}` as described in [RFC-6750](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6750.html).
- `Content-Type` header, set to `application/json`.

For example (using `cURL`):

```bash
curl -X POST https://ingest.valued.app/events \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer my-project-token' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{"category": "action", "key": "account.signin", "user": {"id": 123}}'
```

The ingestion API does not validate the JSON data you send, instead we accept the data and add it to our queue for processing.

There are highly available `listeners` in various global regions which respond within milliseconds, and process the event data without the possibility of affecting the API response time.

There are following `listener` regions:

- Sydney, Australia
- Brussels, Europe
- North Virginia, USA

If you require a `listener` in a different region, please contact us at hello@valued.app.
