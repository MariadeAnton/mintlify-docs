description: Use tiers to define your pricing.
---

Each `tiers` element represents a pricing tier in your product.

## The tier model

Use it to define each pricing tier individually. 

If your product doesn't have tiers, it's a single-tier product. Set `up_to` to `NULL`. 

Use `unit_amount` when you charge per unit. For example, "User based pricing", $10/user.

Use `flat_amount` when you charge one total cost for a given subscription, for example, "Premium plan", that has prices for $20/month, $200/year.
