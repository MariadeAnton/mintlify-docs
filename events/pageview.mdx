title: Pageview
description: Tracking users navigating your application
---

The `pageview` event category enables you to understand how a user is navigating your product, and what pages they are viewing more than others.

The [user](/core-resources/user) is required, but the [customer](/core-resources/customer) is optional. A user undertakes `pageview` events, but pageviews are not necessarily bound to a [customer](/core-resources/customer) account. 

Make sure to include the [customer](/core-resources/customer) id whenever the page being viewed is associated with a customer account.

## Event format

Identify pageview events with `category=pageview`.

### Sending a pageview

```json
{
    "category": "pageview",
    "user": { 
        "id": "457" 
    },
    "customer": { 
        "id": "124"
    },
    "attributes": {
        "source": {
            "url": "https://big.company.com/learn/to/waltz",   
            "referrer": "https://a.shared.link/wow",
            "page_title": "10 easy steps to dancing the waltz!"
        },
    },
}
```
