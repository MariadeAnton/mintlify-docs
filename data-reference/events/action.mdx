title: Action
description: Capturing actions your users perform
---

The `action` event category is for capturing and modeling activity associated with users and customers.

Activities you might want to capture include: a customer or user being created, a user logging in, creating or updating data associated with a customer account, inviting a team member, or downloading a report.

While both [user](/core-resources/user) and [customer](/core-resources/customer) information are optional, at least one of them is required.

Actions can be specific to a user (updating their profile), specific for a customer (subscription payment received), or, in most cases, associated with both (the user invited a team member to a customer account).

## Event format

Action events are identified with `category=action`.

### Customer created event

Customer creation events to capture initial customer data.

```json
{
    "category": "action",
    "key": "customer.created",
    "customer": {
        "id": "124",
        "name": "Greasy's Diner",
        "location": {
            "country": "US",
            "state": "OR"
        }
    }
}

```

### User created event

User creation events to capture your initial user data.

```json
{
    "category": "action",
    "key": "user.created",
    "user": {
        "id": "457",
        "name": "Susan Wentworth",
        "email": "suzan.wentworth@greasysdiner.restaurant",
        "location": {
            "country": "US",
            "state": "OR"
        },
        "hobbies": [
            "cat shows",
            "fixing things",
        ]
    },
    "customer" : {
        "id": "124"
    }
}
```

### User sale created event

Once you've sent initial customer and user data with creation events, other events can just reference the id's the customer and user they are associated with.

```json
{
    "category": "action",
    "key": "sale.created",
    "user": {
        "id": "457"
    },
    "customer": {
        "id": "124"
    },
    "attributes": {
        "total": "213",
        "currency": "USD"
    }
}
```
