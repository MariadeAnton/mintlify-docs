title: Config
description: Config events set up goals and signals in your Valued project
---

The `config` event category is for setting up various elements of your Valued project. Configurable elements include [goals](/core-resources/goals) and [signals](/core-resources/signals).

A new `config` event overwrites the previous `config` event. Make sure to extend configs when you want to expand your goals and signals.

## Event format

Configuration events are identified with `category=config`.
