title: Sync
description: Syncing your customer and user data
---

The sync event category is for updating [user](/core-resources/user) and [customer](/core-resources/customer) profile information and, associated customers and users with [memberships](/core-resources/membership) on Valued. 

To guarantee your data is always up-to-date, include `sync` events in your backend application, running one-off or periodic bulk `sync` imports.

To sync a [user](/core-resources/user) or a [customer](/core-resources/customer) is required, but not both. If both are included, Valued ignores this event.

A [membership](/core-resources/membership) event should only include the membership details.

All event attributes included in the [user](/core-resources/user) or [customer](/core-resources/customer) structure will update all information we have on the [user](/core-resources/user) or [customer](/core-resources/customer).

## Event format

Sync events are identified with `category=sync`.
