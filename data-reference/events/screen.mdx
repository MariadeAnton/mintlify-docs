title: Screen
description: Users navigating your native mobile and desktop apps
---

The `screen` event category enables you to understand how a user is navigating your native mobile and desktop apps.

You will notice that the [user](/core-resources/user) is required, but the [customer](/core-resources/customer) is optional. `screen` events are undertaken by a user, but not nessicarily bound to a [customer](/core-resources/customer) account. It is recommended to include the [customer](/core-resources/customer) id whenever the screen being viewed is associated with a customer account.

## Event format

Screen events are identified with `category=screen`.
