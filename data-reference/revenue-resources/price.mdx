Use price to define the unit of cost, currency and billing cycle for recurring purchases.

Your pricing-model associates a `price` with a given fixed-recurring plan, with a given unit of its corresponding tier, or charges all units based on volume purchased. 

## The price model

The price model has all the information specifying how much, how often and when to charge the given amount.
Set your pricing model using the [`tiers`](/revenue-resources/tier) object.
