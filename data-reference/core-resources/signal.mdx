Signals are a method for tracking your [customers](/core-resources/customer) behaviour over time. These are helpful to identify the drop off in usage of features as potential retention issues or an increase in usage as a signal for expansion.

## The signal model

### Properties

`name` _string_

A unique name representing the signal.

`action_key`  _string_

The [action](/events/action) you want to track.

`metric` _string_

Use `metric` instead of `action_key` to specify a custom `name` and `period` for the two default signals: `active_unique_users` and `user_sessions`.

`outcome`  _string_

Whether the signal is `positive` or `negative` in nature. (Default: `positive`)

`aggregate`  _string_

How to aggregate when comparing the data between the two periods. (Default: `sum`) 

`attribute`  _string_

The attribute in the event data to use for calculating the `aggregate=sum`. 

`threshold`  _integer_

The percentage difference between the previous and current periods to act as the trigger for the signal. It can be either a positive or negative difference.

`period` _string_

The period lengths to aggregate data over.

`alert_if_no_activity` _boolean_

The signal will activate when there are zero events in the current period. (Default: `false`)
