description: Understanding the Valued data model, and how to use it to your advantage.

## Overview

The core of the Valued data model is based on [events](#events), [customers](#customers), and [users](#users), scoped to your [project](#projects).

This data model allows us to better understand your users, the customer accounts they belong to, and the actions they take within your product.

Modern B2B SaaS products support users belonging to multiple customer accounts, and this is reflected in our [event](#events) data modeling. 

We also support the concept of [customer events](#customer-events) as we understand that not all events are associated with a user, For example, if you are extending the trial of a customer, you only need to associate that event with the customer.

## Core models

### Events

To understand feature adoption by your [customers](#customers) and [users](#users) you will need to capture events that represent feature usage and activity. This includes [action](/core/event-definitions#action-events) and [page view](/core/event-definitions#page-view-events) activity throughout your product.

To update information related to a customer or user you can send a [sync](/core/event-definitions#sync-events) to Valued.

More information on the different events you can send to Valued, along with full specifications can be found on the [Event Definitions](/core/event-definitions) page.

### Customers

Customers are a top-level grouping of one or more users. This enables your team to understand how feature adoption and usage activity happens on a customer account level. 

Customer accounts can include personal accounts, team accounts, company accounts, and organization accounts.

Additionally, we support [users](#users) belonging to more than one customer, giving you the flexibility to model team membership as your product models it.

As an example, we recommend capturing and [syncing](/core/event-definitions#sync-events) the following information:

```
id: 123
name: "Highly Valued, Inc."
email: "hello@valued.app"
website: "https://valued.app"
location:
  country: "USA"
  state: "California"
plan_type: "free"
```
